Bowman, Jared Kaplan\\nAnthropic\\nAbstract\\nWe test the hypothesis that language models trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) have the capability to “morally self-correct”—to avoid producing\\nharmful outputs—if instructed to do so. We ﬁnd strong evidence in support of this hypothesis across three different experiments, each of which reveal different facets of moral\\nself-correction. We ﬁnd that the capability for moral self-correction emerges at 22B model\\nparameters, and typically improves with increasing model size and RLHF training. We\\nbelieve that at this level of scale, language models obtain two capabilities that they can use\\nfor moral self-correction: (1) they can follow instructions and (2) they can learn complex\\nnormative concepts of harm like stereotyping, bias, and discrimination. As such, they can\\nfollow instructions to avoid certain kinds of morally harmful outputs. We believe our results are cause for cautious optimism regarding the ability to train language models to abide\\nby ethical principles.\\n1 Introduction\\nLarge language models exhibit harmful social biases [1, 6, 8, 11, 15, 24, 29, 50, 62] that can sometimes\\ngetworse for larger models [2, 18, 20, 43, 55]. At the same time, scaling model size can increase model'}]"
